Note:  
Reason: The ProBook 6460b is slow, heavy, and starting interfere with my work. I started out as contractor in January and received the laptop. After being hired fulltime in May I was told that I would receive a newer laptop but that has not happened. I have begun to travel more frequently for work and I need a fast, reliable, and lighter laptop to use for work.'
